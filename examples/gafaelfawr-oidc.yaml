# Example configuration file for Gafaelfawr using OpenID Connect.

# The recommended installation method is to use the Helm chart, which will
# generate this file based on Helm values as a ConfigMap.  However, this
# example may be useful if you need to modify the Helm chart or
# hand-generate the documentation.
#
# All example.com values in this example should be changed to the domain
# name under which you're running Gafaelfawr.

# Realm for WWW-Authenticate 401 error.
realm: "example.com"

# File contents should be the result of gafaelfawr generate-session-secret.

# The URL of and password for a Redis instance used for storing sessions.
redisUrl: "redis://redis.example.com:6379/0"
redisPasswordFile: "/path/to/redis-password"

# Replace <password> with the database password and example.com with the
# hostname of the PostgreSQL database.  In environments where the
# configuration file is not private (such as when it's taken from a
# Kubernetes ConfigMap), use the GAFAELFAWR_DATABASE_URL environment
# variable to set this parameter and don't include it in the settings
# file.
databaseUrl: "postgresql://gafaelfawr:<password>@example.com/gafaelfawr"

# File contents should be a token generated via gafaelfawr generate-token.

# To get these values, register with an OpenID Connect provider and use
# the values that they provide.  This example is for CILogon; many of the
# values will need to be different for another provider.
