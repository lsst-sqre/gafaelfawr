    This is a thin layer over `~gafaelfawr.storage.firestore.FirestoreStorage`
    and the UID/GID cache that integrates cache management with the underlying
    storage.  It is primarily intended to be used by the user information
    service rather than called directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uid_cache
        The underlying UID and GID cache and locks.
    gid_cache
        The underlying UID and GID cache and locks.
    storage
        The underlying Firestore storage for UID and GID assignment, if
        Firestore was configured.
    logger
        Logger to use.
