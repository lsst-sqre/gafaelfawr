    In some cases, we take user metadata from external systems. Examples are:

    #. Resolve a unique identifier to a username via LDAP.

    #. Assign and manage UIDs and GIDs via Google Firestore.

        Notes
        -----
        This should be sufficient for the most common cases of invalid group
        membership even if there are multiple instances of Gafaelfawr
        running.

        Retrieving LDAP information for a user only happens either (a) during
        the login process, or (b) when checking a user's token (via the /auth
        route, the API, etc.). For the typical case of a user who hasn't
        onboarded yet, (b) is impossible since they haven't previously
        authenticated and have no tokens. When they go through the login
        process, we will retrieve their LDAP information and cache it, but
        then we ask whether they're authorized. If not, we don't issue them a
        token and then invalidate the cache using this method. These both
        happen as part of processing the same request, so they can't be split
        across multiple instances.

        Therefore, in that normal case, this method will remove information
        that was cached as part of the same request, and no other instance of
        Gafaelfawr could have cached LDAP data because the user has not
        successfully authenticated.

        This cache invalidation could be insufficient if the user had
        previously authenticated and then their user information in LDAP
        changed such that they're no longer a member of an eligible group. In
        that case, a cache invalidation done by the login process may be
        undone by the user using an existing unexpired token to authenticate
        to something else, resulting in an LDAP query that will be cached.
        This could cause the confusing behavior that we were hoping to avoid:
        bad LDAP data cached until the cache timeout.

        That said, hopefully this case will be rare compared to the more
        typical case of some onboarding problem. In the case where a user is
        being invalidated entirely, we would normally delete all of their
        tokens as well, avoiding this conflict.
