Gafaelfawr uses a Kopf_ timer to periodically re-check service tokens stored
in secrets and regenerate them if needed.  This timer can conflict with the
update handler if changes were made to the ``GafaelfawrServiceToken`` object
while the operator was not running.  Wait this long after startup and after
any detected change to the object before processing it with the timer to try
to avoid that conflict.

This could be longer for production operation, but the test suite needs to
wait for at least this long to test timer operation, so this is a compromise.
