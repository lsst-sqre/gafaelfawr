Gafaelfawr is named for Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, the knight who challenges King Arthur in *Pa gur yv y porthaur?* and, in later stories, is a member of his court and acts as gatekeeper.
Gafaelfawr is pronounced (very roughly) gah-VILE-vahwr.
(If you speak Welsh and can provide a better pronunciation guide, please open an issue!)
