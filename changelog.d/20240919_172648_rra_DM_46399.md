### Bug fixes

- If the user returns from authentication and no longer has login state in their cookie, redirect them to the destination URL without further processing instead of returning an authentication state mismatch error. The most likely cause of this state is that the user authenticated from another browser tab while this authentication is pending, so Gafaelfawr should use their existing token or restart the authentication process.
