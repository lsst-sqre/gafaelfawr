### Bug fixes

- Fix the group name validation regex so that it accepts all valid usernames, specifically including usernames that start with numbers. Otherwise, if `addUserGroup` is enabled, a user with a username starting with digits would trigger internal validation errors. If that user's token was the most recent created, this could in turn cause health check failures.
