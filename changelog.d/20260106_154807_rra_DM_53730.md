### New features

- Add `gafaelfawr_dependency` to the Gafaelfawr client. This is a FastAPI dependency that provides a Gafaelfawr client that reuses the HTTPX connection pool provided by the Safir dependency and the Repertoire client provided by the Repertoire dependency. FastAPI applications can use this rather than managing the client directly.
