### New features

- Add TAP quotas. Currently, this allows specifying the allowable number of concurrent TAP queries for each of a list of TAP services, with the same override and group-specific addition behavior as API quotas. These quotas are not applied by Gafaelfawr; they are intended for use by TAP services that retrieve quota information from Gafaelfawr and apply it internally.
