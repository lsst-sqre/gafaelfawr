### New features

- Add `config.onlyServices` to `GafaelfawrIngress`, which restricts the ingress to tokens issued to one of the listed services in addition to the other constraints.

### Bug fixes

- Stop including the required scopes in 403 errors when the request was rejected by a username restriction rather than a scope restriction, since the client cannot fix this problem by obtaining different scopes.
