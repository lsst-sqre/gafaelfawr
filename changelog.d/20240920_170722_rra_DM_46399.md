### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The `/auth` and `/auth/anonymous` routes have moved to `/ingress/auth` and `/ingress/anonymous` and are no longer accessible outside of the cluster. These routes may only be accessed by the ingress controller via cluster-internal URLs. This prevents users from creating arbitrary internal tokens for themselves.
- Drop support and remove documentation for configuring an `Ingress` to use Gafaelfawr rather than using the `GafaelfawrIngress` custom resource.
- The `/ingress/auth` route now requires `X-Original-URL` to be set.

### New features

- Setting `config.baseUrl` in a `GafaelfawrIngress` resource is no longer required. That value will be used if present, but only for constructing the login URL, not the `/ingress/auth` URL. Instead, a global default is set by the Helm chart. The `config.baseUrl` setting will be removed entirely in a future release.
