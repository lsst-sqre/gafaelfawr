### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Pass CORS preflight `OPTIONS` requests to a protected service, without checking authentication, if and only if the `Origin` header of the request indicates that the request comes from an origin that is protected by this instance of Gafaelfawr. Gafaelfawr previously effectively blocked all `OPTIONS` requests without authentication by replying with 302 or 401, but the CORS preflight specification says that credentials should not be included.
- Block `OPTIONS` requests that are not CORS preflight requests (detected by not having an `Origin` or `Access-Control-Request-Method` header) with a 404 error unless the ingress explicitly permits them by setting `config.allowOptions` to true. If they are allowed, pass them to the protected service without checking authentication. This is required to support WebDAV servers, which use `OPTIONS` for WebDAV protocol negotiation.
