### New features

- Add new configuration setting `config.allowSubdomains`. If set, Gafaelfawr authentication cookies will be sent to any subdomain of the base URL for the Gafaelfawr installation, allowing ingresses to use cookie authentication with more than one hostname as long as all hostnames are subdomains of the same base hostname. This in turn will allow JavaScript origin isolation between portions of the Rubin Science Platform without requiring complex cross-domain authentication management.
