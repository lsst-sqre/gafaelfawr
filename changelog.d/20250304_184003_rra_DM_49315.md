### New features

- Add new `config.userDomain` setting to `GafaelfawrIngress` that requires the authenticated username be the last component of the hostname of the requested URL. This is intended for use with ingresses that use per-user subdomains, such as [Jupyter labs with origin isolation](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/latest/administrator/security.html#jupyterhub-subdomains).
