### Bug fixes

- Pass multiple delegate scopes to the `/auth` route by repeating the `delegate_scope` query parameter instead of passing a comma-separated list as a single value. ingress-nginx 4.12.0 no longer allows `%` in the `auth-url` annotation and `,` was not initially allowed, and this matches how `scope` was handled.
