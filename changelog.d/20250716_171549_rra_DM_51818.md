### New features

- Add new `/auth/api/v1/users/<username>` API route that returns the LDAP and, if configured, Firestore information about the given username. This route is only available on Gafaelfawr installations that use LDAP and only returns useful information for users in LDAP.
- Add new reserved `admin:userinfo` scope, which controls access to the new `/auth/api/v1/users/<username>` route for usernames other than the one associated with the authenticating token. A token with this scope can be used to look up user information for other users without having a token for that user.
