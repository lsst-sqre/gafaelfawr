- Reject with an error any `GafaelfawrIngress` Kubernetes resource that creates rules for a hostname that does not match the hostname of the base URL or, if `allowSubdomains` is enabled, is a subdomain of it, unless that ingress is anonymous or disables cookie authentication. Such ingresses will never work with web browsers and could create confusing redirect loops.
