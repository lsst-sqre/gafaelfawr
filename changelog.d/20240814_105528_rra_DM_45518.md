### New features

- Add support for exporting metrics to Kafka using the new event metrics support in [Safir](https://safir.lsst.io/). The initial set of events is limited to login metrics, authentications to services, and counts of active sessions and user tokens.

### Bug fixes

- Reset login state after an error so that any subsequent authentication attempt will generate a new, random state parameter.
