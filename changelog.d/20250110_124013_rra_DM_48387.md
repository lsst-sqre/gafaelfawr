### Bug fixes

- If the user returns to the login route without login state and no return URL is set (which will be the common case), redirect them to the after logout URL instead of returning a 403 error. Often this means the user previously authenticated via another tab and is now logged on, but we have lost the return URL and do not know where to send them. Returning the error is more confusing and often causes the user to attempt to reload the error page, which then fails.
