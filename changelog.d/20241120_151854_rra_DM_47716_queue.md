### New features

- Add optional [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) support. If enabled and configured with the Sentry DSN secret, telemetry information will be sent to Sentry. Every trace is sampled and no effort has been made to exclude sensitive information, so this is currently only intended to be temporarily enabled in a non-production environment while debugging a specific problem.

### Other changes

- Update the Gafaelfawr secrets documentation with a link to the current Phalanx secrets management documentation and mark the secrets that are autogenerated by Phalanx tooling.
